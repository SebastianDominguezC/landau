# Monte Carlo: Randomness, Walks, and Decays

Excercises from Computational Physics by Landau, Paez, and Bordeianu, chapter 4.

Data is generated using `Rust`, and then later analyzed with `Matlab` (in most cases).

## Contents

- Random number generation (power residue method) and analysis
- Random walk (3D)
- Protein folding (2D & 3D)
- Spontaneous particle decay
